UAM Port ABM
=============

This webpage contains simulations of the UAM Port ABM under different configurations. For source code, checkout the 
`github repo <https://github.com/pkck28/UAMPort-ABM>`_. The sensitivity study is performed by changing turnaround time,
recharge rate, and number of pads at hub. Following are some of the simulation results:

Simulation 1
------------

Number of pads = 3, turnaround time = 5 min, recharge rate = 2 units/min

Simulation 2
------------

Number of pads = 4, turnaround time = 7 min, recharge rate = 3 units/min

Simulation 3
------------

Number of pads = 5, turnaround time = 9 min, recharge rate = 4 units/min

Simulation 4
------------

Number of pads = 6, turnaround time = 10 min, recharge rate = 5 units/min
