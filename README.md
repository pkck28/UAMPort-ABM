## UAM Port ABM
This repository contains source code for simulating a simple network of UAM ports and vehicles.
The only agent within the model is the EVTOL vehicle which interacts with its environment (i.e. network 
of UAM ports) to perform its mission. Since the model is simple, it is implemented entirely in Python using classes.
Please refer [documentation](https://pkck28.github.io/UAMPort-ABM/) for more details about the model.
