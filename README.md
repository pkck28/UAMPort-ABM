## UAM Port ABM
This repository contains source code for simulating a simple network of UAM ports and eVTOL vehicles as a part 
of homework for AAE 560 System of systems modeling and analysis. The only agent within the model is the EVTOL 
vehicle which interacts with its environment (i.e. network  of UAM ports) to perform its mission. Since the model 
is simple, it is implemented entirely in Python using OOP. Please refer [documentation](https://pkck28.github.io/UAMPort-ABM/) 
for simulation results.
